        Welcome to the Neurophysiology and Neuroengineering Lab <br><br>
        We are a systems neuroscience group at the Department of Biomedicine at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto (Portugal). <br><br>
        By intersecting the fields of neurobiology, electrophysiology, device engineering, machine learning, and brain-computer interfacing, we aim to understand fundamental principles of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop and its involvement in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. <br><br>
        Because experimental answers are sometimes held back by current existing technology, we also develop and use novel neuroengineering approaches to probe, modulate, and model the neurophysiology of brain circuits.
