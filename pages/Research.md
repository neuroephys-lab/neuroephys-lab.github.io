 		 We study how cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo circuits encode and decode information and how disruption of these circuits can lead to brain disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).  Simultaneously, we also develop new technologies with translational potential to monitor and record electrical and chemical neurotransmission, and for non-invasive brain stimulation.

		<h3>NEUROPHYSIOLOGY</h3>
		<p>
			To understand how cellular and synaptic mechanisms interact within neural circuits to control behavior, we combine ideas from genetics, biochemistry, physics and engineering, with in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology techniques, closed-looped brain implants, and other state-of-the-art approaches to study brain circuits in transgenic mouse models of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.

    	<h5>Neurobiological mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorders (ASD)</h5>
    	<p>
			Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect nearly 70 million people worldwide. Several large-scale genomic studies have supported an association between cases of autism spectrum disorder and mutations in the human gene SHANK3. Research studies by us and others have been revealing the biological extent to which mutations in Shank3 can impact brain function and development in zebrafish, mice, rats, and even primates, leading to reduced social interaction and repetitive behavioral patterns in all species. We are currently studying cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo circuits in Shank3-mutant mice and how Shank3 mutations impact sensory processing and social behaviors.

    	<h5>Synaptic dysfunction of corticostriatal circuits in neuropsychiatric disorders</h5>
    	<p>
    		The human brain contains 86 billion neurons that are connected to each other through particular structures called synapses. We are interested in understanding how subtle changes in synapses can affect communication between neurons and trigger brain disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, and stress/anxiety-related disorders.

		<h3>NEUROENGINEERING</h3>
		<p>
			Understanding complex neural systems at the functional level requires novel advanced tools which can only be created with a profound grasp of neurophysiology. Thus we neurophysiology with engineering approaches such as micro/nano-fabrication, materials engineering, electronics, systems engineering, signal processing and machine learning.

    	<h5>Electronic Neural Interfaces</h5>
    	<p>
			Neural interfaces create a direct communication channel between the brain and external electronic devices. They allow studying neural activity with detailed resolution and replacing or augmenting brain function. We are currently developing new technologies to interact with the brain including: electrophysiological neural probes, nanobioelectronic neural interfaces and non-invasive/wireless brain stimulators.
