<b>Neurophysiology and Neuroengineering Lab</b>

Welcome to the Neurophysiology and Neuroengineering Lab

We are a systems neuroscience group at the Department of Biomedicine at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto (Portugal).

By intersecting the fields of neurobiology, electrophysiology, device engineering, machine learning, and brain-computer interfacing, we aim to understand fundamental principles of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop and its involvement in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Because experimental answers are sometimes held back by current existing technology, we also develop and use novel neuroengineering approaches to probe, modulate, and model the neurophysiology of brain circuits.
