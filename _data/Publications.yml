  description: 'Chronic stress (CS) is associated with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, and it may also contribute to or exacerbate motor function. However, the mechanisms by which stress triggers motor symptoms are not fully understood. Here, we report that CS functionally alters dorsomedial striatum (DMS) circuits in male mice, by affecting GABAergic interneuron populations and somatostatin positive (SOM) interneurons in particular. Specifically, we show that CS impairs communication between SOM interneurons and medium spiny neurons, promoting striatal overactivation/disinhibition and increased motor output. Using probabilistic machine learning to analyze animal behavior, we demonstrate that in vivo chemogenetic manipulation of SOM interneurons in DMS modulates motor phenotypes in stressed mice. Altogether, we propose a causal link between dysfunction of striatal SOM interneurons and motor symptoms in models of chronic stress.'

  description: 'Detecting physiological levels of neurotransmitters in biological samples can advance our understanding of brain disorders and lead to improved diagnostics and therapeutics. However, neurotransmitter sensors for real-world applications must reliably detect low concentrations of target analytes from small volume working samples. Herein, a platform for robust and ultrasensitive detection of dopamine, an essential neurotransmitter that underlies several brain disorders, based on graphene multitransistor arrays (gMTAs) functionalized with a selective DNA aptamer is presented. High-yield scalable methodologies optimized at the wafer level were employed to integrate multiple graphene transistors on small-size chips (4.5 × 4.5 mm). The multiple sensor array configuration permits independent and simultaneous replicate measurements of the same sample that produce robust average data, reducing sources of measurement variability. This procedure allowed sensitive and reproducible dopamine detection in ultra-low concentrations from small volume samples across physiological buffers and high ionic strength complex biological samples. The obtained limit-of-detection was 1 aM (10–18) with dynamic detection ranges spanning 10 orders of magnitude up to 100 µM (10–8), and a 22 mV/decade peak sensitivity in artificial cerebral spinal fluid. Dopamine detection in dopamine-depleted brain homogenates spiked with dopamine was also possible with a LOD of 1 aM, overcoming sensitivity losses typically observed in ion-sensitive sensors in complex biological samples. Furthermore, we show that our gMTAs platform can detect minimal changes in dopamine concentrations in small working volume samples (2 µL) of cerebral spinal fluid samples obtained from a mouse model of Parkinson’s Disease. The platform presented in this work can lead the way to graphene-based neurotransmitter sensors suitable for real-world academic and pre-clinical pharmaceutical research as well as clinical diagnosis.'

  description: 'We develop a machine learning classifier to integrate multi-omic epigenetic data and predict dozens of functional SNPs,
  nominating gene and cellular targets for previously orphaned GWAS loci. These predictions both inform well-studied disease-relevant genes,
  such as BIN1 in microglia for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and reveal novel gene-disease associations, such as STAB1 in microglia and MAL in
  oligodendrocytes for Parkinson’s disease (PD). This work greatly expands our understanding of inherited variation in AD and PD and provides
  a roadmap for the epigenomic dissection of noncoding regulatory variation in disease.'

  description: 'We present the genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles of 410 tumor samples
  spanning 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identify 562,709
  transposase-accessible DNA elements that substantially extend the compendium of known
  cis-regulatory elements. Integration of ATAC-seq with TCGA multi-omic data identifies a large number of
  putative distal enhancers that distinguish molecular subtypes of cancers and nominates long-range
  gene-regulatory interactions in cancer. Moreover, these data pinpoint noncoding mutations that
  drive enhancer activation and may affect patient survival. These results suggest a
  systematic approach to understanding the noncoding genome in disease to advance diagnosis and therapy.'

  applications with substantial improvement of signal-to-background ratio and information content. The Omni-ATAC
  protocol generates high-quality chromatin accessibility profiles from almost any starting material, from cell lines to archival
  frozen tissue samples and 50-µm sections. Moreover, Omni-ATAC saves money through fraction of reads in peaks and lower fraction
  of reads mapping to the mitochondrial chromosome.'

  description: 'We define the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional landscapes in 13 human primary blood cell types that
  span the hematopoietic hierarchy. Exploiting the finding that the enhancer landscape better reflects cell identity than mRNA
  levels, we enable enhancer cytometry for enumeration of pure cell types from complex populations. We identify regulators
  governing hematopoietic differentiation and further show the lineage ontogeny of genetic elements linked to diverse human
  diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chromatin accessibility uncovers unique regulatory evolution in cancer cells with
  a progressively increasing mutation burden. Single AML cells exhibit distinctive mixed regulome profiles corresponding to
  disparate developmental stages.'
