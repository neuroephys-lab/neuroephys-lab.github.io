  description: 'ArchR is a full-featured R package for processing and analyzing single-cell ATAC-seq data.
  ArchR provides the most extensive suite of scATAC-seq analysis tools of any software available. Additionally,
  ArchR excels in both speed and resource usage, making it possible to analyze 1 million cells in 8 hours on a MacBook Pro laptop.
  ArchR is currently in beta. You can find everything you need on our [website](https://www.archrproject.com/)
  or in the [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00790-6).'

  description: 'Omni-ATAC is a carefully optimized ATAC-seq method that provides improvements on data quality, cost, and generalizability.
  It works on every cell type that we have tested, from cell lines to flash frozen tissues. The original protocol can be found as
  [Supplementary Protocol 1](/pdfs/OmniATAC_Protocol.pdf) of Corces et al. Nature Methods 2017 and an __updated protocol for nuclei
  isolation from frozen tissue__ can be found [on protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/view/isolation-of-nuclei-from-frozen-tissue-for-atac-se-6t8herw).'
