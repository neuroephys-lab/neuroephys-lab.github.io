  description: "From a young age, I was always interested in science, especially the science behind different diseases. I majored in Biomedical
  Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin to learn more about the real-world applications of scientific and medical research. At UT, I joined
  Dr. Aaron Baker's lab and studied nerve damage after traumatic injury. There, I helped engineer and test neural microelectrodes, and I also published
  an undergraduate thesis on drug delivery methods that could speed up nerve regrowth. Now, in the Corces lab, I work on neurodegeneration in a different
  context as it relates to the epigenetics of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. My research experience has ignited in me a
  fascination with the brain, and I aim to join a neuroscience PhD program in the future."

  description: "I grew up in Idaho, born to Argentinian parents. After falling in love with biology late in high school thanks to Campbell Biology's
  Tour of the Cell chapter, I went to Washington State University (WSU) to pursue a bachelor's in biochemistry. While at WSU, I fell in love with
  genome regulation while working on transposable elements and the variety of ways they create genomic and epigenetic variation.  In 2014, I graduated
  and went on to pursue a Ph.D. at Stanford University in the lab of Nidhi Bhutani. There, I studied DNA methylation, specifically the regulation of
  5-hydroxymethylcytosine dynamics by the TET family of enzymes in the context of skeletal development and disease, including dissecting the relationship
  between 5hmC deposition and SOX9 transcription factor activity. During graduate school, I also became interested in pursuing the use of single-cell
  technologies to understand how the epigenome shapes cell fate, and specifically how it can store information about environmental conditions like chronic
  inflammation that cause disease. Now, I'm combing these two interests to study mechanisms of resilience to AD in the Corces lab."

  description: "I was born and raised in the East Bay Area, California, leaving in 2017 to attend Cal Poly Humboldt for a Bachelor’s in
  Plant Biology. While there, I had the opportunity to work in the lab of Dr. Mihai Tomescu, where I helped identify a plant from 400
  million years ago. My work with Dr. Tomescu culminated in a scientific paper recently submitted to the American Journal of Botany. After
  graduation, I returned to the East Bay and joined Bio-Rad as a research associate. There I worked to develop innovative PCR reagents and
  optimize a novel droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing workflow. Most recently I made the move to San Francisco to join the Corces Lab
  at the Gladstone Institutes. In the Corces lab, I’ll be using my molecular biology expertise to perform single-cell multi-omic experiments
  in order to ultimately further our understanding of how genetic factors contribute to Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Disease. Outside of work,
  I enjoy gardening and volunteering in hospice."
