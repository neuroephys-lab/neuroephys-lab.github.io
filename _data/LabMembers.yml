  description: "Alexandra has a background in Biochemistry from the University of Coimbra, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, and a Master in Biomedical Research from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra. During her MSc, Alexandra studied the impact of prenatal stress on the offspring’s behavior and microglia morphology. In 2022, she joined our team as a lab tech but her scientific passion led her to pursue a PhD with us. As a PhD student, she is currently exploring the involvement of the brain immune system in OCD."

  description: "Mafalda has a background in Engineering Physics but was drawn to Neuroscience during her master’s thesis where she explored graphene biosensors for neurotransmitters’ detection in the brain. Her interest in brain physiology and 2D materials led her to pursue a PhD in graphene nanobioelectronics. As a PhD student, she is currently developing new graphene devices for neural interfacing. (in collaboration with the 2D Materials and Devices group at INL)"
