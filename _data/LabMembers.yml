  description: "I grew up in the Bay Area and studied Biochemistry and General Biology as an undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego. During my time there,
  I joined Dr. Derek Welsbie's ophthalmology lab focusing on the development of gene therapies/small molecules to mitigate degeneration in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with
  hopes for vision restoration in glaucoma patients. I had the opportunity to design plasmid constructs for CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and to work on optimizing the
  differentiation of human STEM cells into RGCs. In my final quarter as an undergraduate, I was introduced to and amazed by the field of epigenetics which led me to join the
  Corces Lab where I could dive further into epigenomic profiling of major neurodegenerative diseases. When I'm not in lab, I like crocheting tiny plushies and trying new coffee places."

  description: "I grew up in the Bay Area, then moved to the midwest to study Neuroscience and Psychological & Brain Sciences at Washington
  University in St. Louis. There, I joined the lab of Yehuda Ben-Shahar to study how homologs of genes that cause Williams Syndrome, a
  human developmental condition characterized by hypersociability, affect social behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. I graduated in 2019, 
  and after continuing on as lab manager for a year, I joined the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program at UCSF. Now, as part of the Corces
  Lab, I am pivoting to study human patient data directly, and using cellular models to understand the etiology of neurodegenerative and
  neuropsychiatric diseases at genomic and epigenetic levels."
