  description: "Mafalda has a background in Engineering Physics but was drawn to Neuroscience during her master’s thesis where she explored graphene biosensors for neurotransmitters’ detection in the brain. Her interest in brain physiology and 2D materials led her to pursue a PhD in graphene nanobioelectronics. As a PhD student, she is currently developing new graphene devices for neural interfacing."
