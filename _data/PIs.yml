  description: "Patricia Monteiro is a Principal Investigator at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto (FMUP), Portugal, since October 2022. Prior to this appointment, Dr. Monteiro was a Principal Investigator at the ICVS institute, University of Minho, between 2018-2022. <br>

Dr. Monteiro holds a BSc/MSc degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences (FFUC, University of Coimbra) and a PhD in Biosciences with specialization in Neuroscience. She received her doctoral training from Prof. Guoping Feng at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA (2010-2015), later moving to Prof. Nuno Sousa lab (2016-2018) as an EMBO postdoctoral fellow. <br>

As Principal Investigator of the NeuroEphys Lab, Dr. Monteiro uses electrophysiology recordings, rodent behavioral tasks, transgenic mice, optogenetics and chemogenetics to study brain circuits in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). <br>

She is an invited junior member of the Portuguese National Academy of Sciences and an Advisory Board Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), serving for their Scientific Exchange Grants (SEG) program."

Dr. Jacinto holds a PhD in Biomedical Engineering  with specialization in Neuroscience (University of Minho, 2013), a BSc in Biology (FCUP, University of Porto) and a MSc in Biomedical Engineering, with specialization in Biomedical Instrumentation (FEUP, University of Porto). Dr. Jacinto received doctoral training at the Center for Neural Engineering, Penn State University, USA and ICVS, Universtiy of Minho, Portugal. He held postdoctoral positions at the Brain Institute, University of Utah, USA (2014) and ICVS (2014-2019). <br>

As Principal Investigator of the NeuroEphys Lab, Dr. Jacinto uses biological and engineering approaches to create novel neurotechnologies that can advance fundamental neuroscience research and provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for brain disorders. Through a combination of electrophysiology, optogenetics, brain-machine interfacing, systems engineering, micro/nanofabrication, and machine learning, he develops electrophysiological neural probes, bioelectronic interfaces for neurotransmitter sensing, stimulators for wireless and non-invasive brain activity modulation, and methodologies for neural signal analysis and complex behavior detection. The ultimate goal of his work is to translate these innovations to the clinical realm and advance the understanding of how our brain integrates and processes information to interact with the world."
